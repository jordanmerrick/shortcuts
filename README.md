# My Collection of Workflows

This repository contains workflows that I've created for the iOS app [Workflow](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l64N).

Most of the workflows have self-explanatory names. Some of the more complex ones include instructions within the workflow. Those that I have specifically written about are linked to the relevant post.
