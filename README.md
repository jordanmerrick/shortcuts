# My Collection of Shortcuts

This repository contains shortcuts that I've created for the iOS app [Shortcuts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id915249334?at=10l64N).

Most of the shortcuts have self-explanatory names. Some of the more complex ones include instructions in comment boxes. Those that I have specifically written about are listed below and linked to the relevant post.
